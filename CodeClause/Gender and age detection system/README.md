## Dataset 📷

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new).

The dataset consists of facial images labeled with corresponding age and gender information. Ensure that the dataset is structured as per the code's expectations, with images placed inside the directory specified by `BASE_DIR`.

### Data Format 📊

-   **Images**: The images should be in the appropriate format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
-   **Labels**: Age and gender labels should be provided as described in the code.

## Usage 🚀

1.  **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure that the dataset is ready as per the instructions above.
2.  **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.
3.  **Make Predictions**: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Model Architecture 🧠

The model consists of several layers, including:

-   **Conv2D Layers**: Four convolutional layers with 32, 64, 128, and 256 filters, respectively, each followed by a MaxPooling2D layer.
-   **Dense Layers**: Two dense layers with 256 units each, followed by dropout layers.
-   **Output Layers**: Two output layers for gender and age predictions.

## Results 📊

### Training and Validation Accuracy for Gender Prediction:

-   Training Accuracy: Extracted from the code (e.g., `acc` variable)
-   Validation Accuracy: Extracted from the code (e.g., `val_acc` variable)

### Training and Validation Loss for Gender and Age Prediction:

-   Loss graphs for both gender and age predictions are available in the notebook.

## Improvements and Future Work 🚀🔮

While the model achieves satisfactory results, there are several avenues for further improvement:

-   **Data Augmentation**: Applying data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data.
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and model architecture.
-   **Advanced Models**: Exploring more sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNet, Inception, etc.
-   **Multi-task Learning**: Enhancing the model to predict additional attributes, such as ethnicity or emotion.

These enhancements can lead to improved accuracy and robustness in real-world applications.

## Model Architecture 🏗️

The model is implemented using a Sequential model in Keras, with multiple Conv2D layers, MaxPooling2D layers, and Dense layers. Dropout layers are also included to prevent overfitting.

### Layers 🌈

-   **Conv2D Layers**: Convolutional layers to extract features from the images.
-   **MaxPooling2D Layers**: Pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality.
-   **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification.
-   **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting.

## Results 📈

The notebook includes sections for visualizing the model's performance, training and validation accuracy, and loss graphs. You can also make predictions on new images to test the model's performance.

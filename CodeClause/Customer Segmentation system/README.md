# Customer Segmentation Analysis 📊

## Overview 📝
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of customer data, particularly in the areas of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The analysis includes data preprocessing, scaling, and a variety of visualizations to understand the underlying patterns and correlations in the dataset.

## Dataset 🗃️
The dataset used for this analysis can be downloaded from Kaggle using the following link:

## How to Run the Code 🏃‍♂️
1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn) installed.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run the cells in sequential order to see the analysis and visualizations.

## Code Explanation 🧠
### Preprocessing
- **Data Types & Null Values**: Checking the data types and null values to ensure data consistency.
- **Drop Unnecessary Columns**: Removing columns that are not required in the analysis.
- **Scaling**: Scaling selected features using the Standard Scaler from Scikit-Learn.

### Visualization
- **Correlation Matrix**: Calculating and displaying correlations between features.
- **Pair Plot**: Visualizing pairwise relationships between features.
- **Heatmap**: Plotting a heatmap for correlations.
- **Histograms & Distribution Plots**: Creating visualizations to understand the distribution of selected features.

## Potential Improvements 💡
- **Feature Engineering**: Additional features could be created to enhance the analysis.
- **Modeling**: Implementing clustering algorithms like K-Means to segment customers into different groups.
- **Performance Metrics**: Introducing metrics to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of any applied models.
- **Documentation**: Adding more comments and explanations within the code for better understanding.
